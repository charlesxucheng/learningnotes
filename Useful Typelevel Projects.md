Notably:
- Cats functional programming library
- Cats Collections: Data structures that facilitate pure functional programming with Cats
- Cats-Effect: A high-performance, asynchronous, composable framework for building real-world applications in a purely functional style within the Typelevel ecosystem. It provides a concrete tool, known as **"the `IO` monad"**, for capturing and controlling actions, often referred to as "**effects**", that your program wishes to perform within a resource-safe, typed context with seamless support for concurrency and coordination. These effects may be asynchronous (callback-driven) or synchronous (directly returning values); they may return within microseconds or run infinitely.
- Cats-MTL: Provides transformer typeclasses for cats' Monads, Applicatives and Functors.
- Cats-Parse: Parsing library (e.g. parse input values)
- Cats-Scalatest: Provides extra matchers and helpers for Scalatest, e.g. matching Either and Validated values.
- Cats-Time: Instances for Cats Typeclasses for Java 8 Time.
- Circe: JSON library
- Ciris: Functional, lightweight, and composable configuration loading
	- Decline: Command-line parser
- Doobie: functional JDBC library
- Edomata: Event-driven State machines / Automata
- EFF: Extensible effects, alternative to monad transformers
- Extruder: Populate case classes from any configuration source (think of Pydantic)
- Fabric: Object-Notation Abstraction for JSON, binary, HOCON, etc.
- Feral: Serverless functions in Scala
- FF4S: Web frontend framework for Scala.js
- Frameless: Spark library with more expressive types
- FS2: Functional, effectful, concurrent streams processing library that pwoers powers [http4s](https://http4s.org/), [skunk](https://typelevel.org/skunk/), and [doobie](https://tpolecat.github.io/doobie/)
- Grackle: GraphQL Server
- Hammock: HTTP Client
- HTTP4S: HTTP library for client and server applications
- Kittens: Automatic type class derivation
- Laika: Site and e-book generator and customizable text markup transformer
- Log4Cats: Logging that plays nicely with Cats-effect
- Mouse: Enrichment for Scala types such as Any, Boolean, String, List.
- Natchez: Distributed tracing library
- Refined: Refines types with type-level predicates which constrain the set of values described by the refined type.
- Scalacheck: Property-based testing
- Scoverage: Code coverage tool
- Shapeless: Generic programming library
- Skunk: Data access library for Scala + Postgres
- Spire: Numeric library
- Specs2: Executable software specifications (for testing and verification)
